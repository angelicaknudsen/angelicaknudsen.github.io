                Objective
            </h3>

            <p>
                This project is done as part of MIT Wind, a competitor in the US Department of Energy's 2026 Collegiate
                Wind Competition in the northeast region. The competition has three main components that contribute to
                your team's overall score: turbine design, turbine performance, and project
                development+connection creation.
            </p>

            <p>
                As build lead of MIT Wind, I lead the mechanical and electrical subteams on the design and testing of
                the turbine. The designs presented here are preliminary and will be iterated in the coming
                months.

            <p>
                So far, we designed a rudimentary, bare-bones turbine that has all the mechanical parts that enable
                power generation, pictured below.
