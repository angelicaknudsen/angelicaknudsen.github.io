            <p>
                Program part of my undergraduate research in coastal acidification during summer of 2023.
                Designed to process and graph data from the Hanna, Manta +35, and YSI CastAway sensors in order to streamline research process.
                Using the Python library matplotlib, I converted files to .csv when needed, cleaned the data,
                and then graphed it on an interactive interface where when you click the window, it cycles
                through different parameters. Program is meant to be ran through command line interface.

                Cut about 5-10 minutes spent necessary for viewing data from each file,
                as some files had about 10+ parameters
