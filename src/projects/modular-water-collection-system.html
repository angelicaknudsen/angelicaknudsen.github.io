            <p>
                Proof of concept part of the class 2.00A (Designing for the Future: Earth, Sea, and Space).
                Aim of design was to optimize water collection for marine research. Worked with other students
                to design a modular system with detachable test tubes and a peristaltic pump that turns and dispenses water from a flexible tube.

            <p>
                Largely was in charge of CAD for acrylic base and gear bearing system
            </p>
            <p>
                Design was able to pump water into 8 test tubes on revolving base, which would improve on the current sampling efficiency of most commercial water samplers, which have 4 samples for each drone deployment
