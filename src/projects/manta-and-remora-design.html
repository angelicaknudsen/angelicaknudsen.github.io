            <p>
                This project was done as part of the class 2.013: Engineering Systems Design. Our project was to design a seamlessly coupled remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) and unmanned surface vehicle (USV) for cost-effective, self-sustained, and time-efficient inspections of offshore wind farm foundations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since this product will possibly be part of a start-up, I have minimized giving away too much information on specific design choices, so I apologize for the vagueness of the following descriptions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="outcomes">
            <h3>
                Outcomes & Contributions
            </h3>

            <p>
                 Although everyone in the class worked closely together on the subsystems, we were roughly split into the USV team (10 people), ROV team (10 people), and the launch and recovery system team (LARS, 5 people), but there was much overlap between the teams. I was on the ROV and LARS subteams.
            </p>

            <p>
                We managed to flesh out the design of Manta and Remora, and kept the design within the budget of $50,000.
            </p>
   
            <p>
                One of my specific tasks was to research the best type of tether, as we kept our ROV tethered to the USV for optimal power and data transmission as well as to keep the LARS mechanisms simpler.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also designed the most recent iteration of the custom winch, as most commercial winches did not meet our desired specifications or were outside of our budget.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are definitely ways to simplify the design, as there are likely ways to omit the standoffs on the motor-side of the winch, and the 3" diameter delrin rods are likely overkill in terms of keeping the system structurally intact.
            </p>
